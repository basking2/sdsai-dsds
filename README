Often NoSQL solutions sacrifice data structures and query features to support
high availability and scalability.

This project attempts to provide basic data structures for various
document storage solutions. If a user implements the class NodeStore they 
should be able to use a Circularly Doubly Linked List and a B-Tree
with the data store they choose.

This project currently provides a MongoDB and Directory implementation
of the NodeStore interface.
